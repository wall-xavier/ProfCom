# Profos-Systems Communication (ProfCom)

## Purpose

This was a personal project created for the Weber State Cyber Club. This was a proof of concept for a custom networking protocol for students to analyze. This is intentionally vulnerable to many different attacks so it should not be used in a production environment!
